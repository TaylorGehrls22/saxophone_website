Lessons
=======

We offer lessons Monday through Fridays from 8-5. We have instructors that are able to teach to a variety of skilled musicians from beginner to professional. We recommend that if you are looking to take a lesson you have the following:
saxophone
reeds 
music book
music stand
The lessons generally run for a half an hour, but if you would like to make special arrangements with our instructors, you are welcome to call and ask about our flexibility.
