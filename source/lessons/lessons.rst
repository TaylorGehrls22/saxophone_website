Lessons
=======

We offer lessons Monday through Fridays from 8-5. We have instructors that are able to teach to a variety of skilled musicians from beginner to professional. We recommend that if you are looking to take a lesson you have the following:
saxophone
reeds 
music book
music stand

The lessons generally run for a half an hour, but if you would like to make special arrangements with our instructors, you are welcome to call and ask about our flexibility. Below youâ€™ll find a list of when all of our instructors are available, so you can find a time with an instructor you prefer. Otherwise, you can just call and give us your availability and we can do the scheduling for you! If you have any questions about which books to get, you can look on `this music book website <http://musicbooksplus.com/>`_ or contact your instructor prior to the lesson and they will give you that information.

We also like our lesson groups to prepare a solo piece for our annual winter concert that we host for the community. This helps us to have something to work towards during the lesson and show your improvement at the end of the year. There is also an opportunity to perform as a duet or in our trio groups at the concert as well.
