Testimonials of Saxin' with Jackson Customers
---------------------------------------

**Bob Smith says:**

*I love this company! They have groovy saxophones and great service! Whenever
I have a problem with my 20 saxophones that I need help with, they never 
hesitate to help me out! Their customer service is so friendly and I can 
reach them day or night. When I’m playing my groovy tunes at 3:00am
and a part on my saxophone breaks, I know that I can call them up and 
there will be someone at my door in 10 minutes or less willing to help
me fix it! I LOVE this place!*

**Carol Jenkins says:**

*Although I am not a super fan of the saxophone, I have heard such great
reviews of this place and they definitely measure up. I recommend it to
all my musically-inclined friends! My daughter has just started playing
the saxophone and their lessons have helped her so much. I can’t wait
until she is at pro-level!*

**Mr. Frank says:**

*As a junior high band teacher, this place has been so helpful for me and
my students! Their instructors and sales representatives are so 
knowledgeable and able to get us great prices on our instruments! They 
also help us with any repairs we may need, and for students in junior 
high, there are a lot of repairs needed!*
