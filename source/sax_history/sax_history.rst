A Short History of the Saxophone
================================

Invented by Adolphe Sax in Belgium, the saxophone was meant to be a balance between brass, woodwind, and string instruments. The saxophone combines a brass body and a woodwind mouthpiece.

   An Alto Saxophone

Adolphe Sax's C Bass Saxophone was the first to debut, appearing in a concert in France on February 3rd, 1844.

-------------------------------
After the 19th Century
-------------------------------
The popularity of the saxophone in France quickly rose that year. French military bands began to replace classic woodwind instruments with saxophone. As its popularity rose, the instrument changed. Keys added, rollers introduced. The introduction of jazz in the 1910s made saxophone an important part of pop culture.

Saxophone has continued to be a staple of jazz, while frequently featured in famous songs from different genres--from Pink Floyd to Jason Derulo.

Types of Saxophones
------------------------------

Although a more rare instrument since the turn of the 20th century, the saxophone first debuted by Adolphe Sax was a C Bass saxophone. The C Bass saxopone is unique for its long neck, huge body, and difficulty playing. It is one of the lowest saxophones, preceeding the contrabass and unplayable subcontrabass.
