Company History
===============

Our company was started back in 1905 when Christopher Jackson got to play his uncle’s new saxophone. Christopher fell in love with the sound and decided to bypass medical school, and instead dedicate his life to the majestic saxophone. Since then, the company, Saxin’ with Jackson, has been passed down in the family. First it was owned by Christopher, then his daughter Lil’ Betty, then her son Christopher Jr., then his son Frank, and is currently owned by his daughter, Lexy. 

In 1920, our main store was burnt down by an accidental fire and we had to rebuild. Although we lacked the funds for a new main store, we were able to raise the funds through a community fundraiser and construct a beautiful new building to hold our new saxophones. In 1935, we added on our saxophone repair center and added saxophone repairs to our list of services offered. In 1997, we partnered with local schools to provide free lessons for students interested in learning more about the saxophone. Since then, we have taught over 103 students the art of masterfully playing the saxophone and we continue to have a higher enrollment in lessons each year.
