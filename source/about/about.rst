I have a passion for music and the sax sound! I grew up right next door from Christopher Jackson’s old house and it gave me such an admiration for this company and the work we do! In my free time you can find me with an old rusty saxophone playing some tunes or playing scrabble with my family.

My favorite instrument has always been the saxophone, ever since we picked our instruments in elementary school. I can help you with any question about the saxophone you could ever have! In my free time, you can find me listening to classic jazz or buying crafting supplies at my favorite crafting corner stores!

I’m a fan of all the woodwind instruments, but especially the saxophone. It is so majestic and inspiring, I just cannot get enough of it. I am always hunting for different models of the saxophone that produce the best sound. In my free time, I enjoy long walks along the beaches in Iowa or playing with my cat, Furball.
