Now that the 2016 concert series has ended it is time to begin ticket sales for the 2017 season. A variety of artists representing the saxophone across different genres are coming to a city near you.

*Tickets available through TicketMaster.*

A big change from the 2016 concert season is the division of events by month. 

* January

  * January is all about the origins of jazz. Hear jazz music that was written before it could be recorded, played by “Saxin’” artists.

* February

  * Continuing through the history of jazz, February holds several events with some of the top big bands around the world, playing big band classics.

* March

  * March will feature genres of jazz that rebel against big band. Bebop, Cool, Hard Bop are some of the styles to expect from performances in March.

* April

  * April slows things down with funk. A fun month with many opportunities for sight-readers in the audience.

* May

  * May keeps the theme of April going with more funk, cool rock, some of the popular funky songs from the 1960s and 70s.

* June

  * The strength of the saxophone in classic rock will shine through during June. Get ready for endless ballads.

* July

  * Summer is picking up and the music heats up too. Expect pop and dance songs that feature the saxophone.

* August

  * Another month of dance music is always great, which is why pop and saxophone will continue to meld during August.

* September

  * Cool things down during the month of September. All the disco hits are coming back. 

* October

  * The month might be spooky but the music is great. Bands and artists will be featuring the saxophone on combo songs.

* November

  * Modern big band is the theme of November.

* December

  * It’s that time of the year! Our concert series is no different. Expect holiday music with saxophone solos during December.
